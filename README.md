# Note from Flare576

I exported the PDF to a .txt and wrote a little UI around the files. Just open the viewer.html in your browser, `Browse` for the two files, and hit `Load Files`.

### How to Use

Prev/Next literally increment/decrement the question number. If you hit Random, then "Prev," it won't take you to the last question you saw.

"Random" will avoid questions you've already seen via "Random"

You can use the ✅ and ❌ buttons to track your score.

## Some of the Questions Don't Have Answers

Correct, I didn't augment any of the answers - I just fixed formatting enough for the UI to function

## Some of the Answers Seem Wrong

Agreed - I didn't augment any of the answers, and some (i.e., 291) seem wrong, but I'm leaving them as-is for now

## Do You Guarantee My Success?

I don't even guarantee **MY** success, so no.
